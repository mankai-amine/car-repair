# Mr Car FeelBetter
These are the requirements of the project:
1. About us:
An old grunge band leader who loved to fix cars decided to start his own car repair shop. Now
in business for 15 years and specializing in old vintage cars.
2. What we expect:
We would like a new updated website because our old site looks like it was made in the 70s
and doesnâ€™t work very well anymore. Something dark, no bright colors.
3. Content:
We want to show off some of our repairs with some before and after pictures. We also need a
so way for our clients to contact us with potential questions and repairs and definitely, a list of
some of more basic repairs and their associated costs. Our home page we should like very
simple with just an image of our store front.
4. External Data:
I think we only have the basics Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram
Also our new logo should be available soon, remind us to give it to you for the site.

Stack: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
